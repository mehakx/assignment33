# Abstract Art Archive - Interactive Collection

An interactive application for organizing and curating a collection of abstract artworks through drag-and-drop interactions.

## 🎨 Project Overview
 Users can organize a collection of 15 abstract artworks by dragging them into categories, reordering them, or removing items from the collection.
 I made this as a showcase of organizing, and being able to curate almost a digital gallery of all your artworks.
