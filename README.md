1. ✅ **15+ Items**: 15 unique artworks included
2. ✅ **Interactive Rearrangement**: Drag-and-drop with category organization

## 🌟 Creative Approach

**What are we collecting?**
Abstract artworks representing different styles - geometric patterns, organic forms, minimalist designs, and artistic photography.

**What does rearrangement mean?**
Users can curate their own exhibition by organizing artworks into categories (Favorites, Geometric, Organic, Minimalist) and arranging them in their preferred order.

**Organization Structure**
The category system provides structure while allowing flexibility. Users can create their own curated collections within each category.
